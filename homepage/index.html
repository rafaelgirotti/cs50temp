            <p>Created by Mark ReinÂ·Hagen, Vampire: The Masquerade was the first of White Wolf Game Studio's World of Darkness live-action and role-playing games,
                based on the Storyteller System and centered around vampires in a modern Gothic-Punk world.</p>
            <p>The Revised Edition, sometimes alternately referred to as the Third Edition by fans, was released in 1998 and explains, "the setting of Vampire is a composite of its populace
            and their despair". The title of the series comes from "The Masquerade", referring to the Camarilla's attempts to hide vampirism from humans and their governments and mass media.</p>
            <p>In 1992, Vampire: The Masquerade won the Origins Award for Best Roleplaying Rules of 1991. The game line was discontinued in 2004, and followed by revised rules and a new setting
                in Vampire: The Requiem.</p>
            <p>The game resumed limited publication in 2011 with Vampire: The Masquerade 20th Anniversary Edition. A new edition with significant system changes was announced in 2017 followed
                closely by an open alpha playtest. Following a secondary play test, which was a revisit to Gary, Indiana, Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition or V5 came out in August of 2018.</p>
